# Note to self: 6 steps to perfecting minimalism in web design

- Embrace flat design
- Incorporate white space
- Limit choices
- Focus on bold typography
- Simplify your navigation
- Use color in patches
- Minimalism works if you know how to use it

Mention the word “minimalism” to some designers, and they become apprehensive because they wrongly think that an overly simplistic site design will be unattractive. As the above examples demonstrate, however, nothing could be farther from the truth.

Done right, minimalism in site design can lead to some new and hot trends like flat design or help make site owners more money by increasing conversions when choice is limited. All in all, minimalism creates a clean, well-organized and neat website that makes things easier for your site visitors. That’s reason alone to use it in your site design.
