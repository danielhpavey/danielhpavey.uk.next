# Joomla! Styleguide Component

Website Styleguides are very 'de rigueur' at the moment. I work with [Joomla!](http://joomla.org) a lot and felt that a Styleguide component could be useful. 

These website styleguides are often also called Pattern Libraries. 

I think they can be very useful!

[My component is currently available on Github](https://github.com/spacecadet9/com_styleguide)
