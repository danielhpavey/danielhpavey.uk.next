# The One-Minute Test — UIE Brain Sparks — Medium

Meeting can be a bit of a roller coaster. Sometimes they're great, sometimes they're terrible. Sometimes they're both!

I really like this idea written about on [http://medium.com]. 

> Often, when we meet with design teams, we’ll reserve a few minutes at the tail end of the meeting to do an unusual type of wrap-up. We ask each participant in the meeting to, on a sheet of paper, answer the following three questions with a total time limit of 60-seconds:
>
- What was the big idea? (What was the most important thing you heard at the meeting?)
- What was your big surprise? (What was the thing you saw or heard that surprised you the most?)
- What’s your big question? (What’s the biggest unanswered question you have at this time?)

Everyones answers are then discussed either by participants reading out what they have written or if the meeting was a bit tense, answers can be collected and read out by a *moderator*.

Again, I do like this idea, although I'm not completely sure of the practicality of doing this at every meeting!
