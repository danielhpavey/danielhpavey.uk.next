# Selective Git Add

> git add -u

This [git](https://git-scm.com/) command looks at the *already* tracked files and stages the changes to those files if they are different or have been removed...

I found this command when I had a lot of modified files and a good handful of new files, but only wanted to commit the changed ones. In the past I would have manually added each individual file. This way is much quicker!
