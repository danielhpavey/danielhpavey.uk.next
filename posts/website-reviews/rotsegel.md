# Rotsegel

I'm not completely sure what these people do (this site is in German and I don't speak German) However I find something strangely satisfying about the layout of this websites homepage.

I think it might be the circles... Most things on the web are usually in squares, so a nice circle stands out quite a bit.

The site designers have also used an interesting image and the borders give an overall *clean* feeling.

I don't really like the drop downs in the menu (I generally don't like drop downs) and it's a shame the whole circles are not clickable, rather than just the small text links in them.

But apart those small complaints the site is nice. And of course it is responsive!
