# Carriage Return in Microsoft Excel Cell

I’m always having to google this one…

Just can’t seem to keep it in my head…

So this is for my benefit as much as for anyone else’s, but if you find this and it helps you I’m glad!

To insert a carriage return in a Microsoft excel spreadsheet cell use the following key combination:

> Windows: Alt + Enter
>
> Mac: Control + Option + Enter

Good luck to you and may the odds be ever in your favour!!
