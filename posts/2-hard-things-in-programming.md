# 2 Hard Things in Computer Science

I've long been a fan of this quote from Phil Karlton

> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things"

However I am an even bigger fan of the slight variation on it:

> "There are only two hard things in Computer Science: cache invalidation and naming things, and off-by-1 errors"
